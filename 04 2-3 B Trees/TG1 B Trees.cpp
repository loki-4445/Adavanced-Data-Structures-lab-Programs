/*
In the provided code, the behavior resembling a B-tree occurs mainly due to the utilization of the two key characteristics inherent to both B-trees and binary search trees (BSTs): sorted order and efficient searching.

Sorted Order:

B-trees and BSTs both maintain a sorted order of elements. In a B-tree, each node contains keys sorted in ascending order, while in a BST, the left subtree of a node contains keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains keys greater than the node's key.
The inorderTraversal function in the provided code performs an in-order traversal of the BST, storing the node values in a vector nums. This operation ensures that nums contains the elements of the BST in sorted order, akin to the sorted keys in a B-tree node.
Efficient Searching:

B-trees and BSTs both offer efficient searching capabilities. B-trees achieve this by maintaining balance and ensuring that the height of the tree remains logarithmic relative to the number of keys, allowing for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
In the provided code, the findTarget function utilizes the sorted order of elements in nums, obtained through in-order traversal, to efficiently search for pairs of elements summing up to a target value k. The two-pointer approach implemented in this function leverages the sorted nature of nums to traverse it efficiently and find the desired pairs.
In summary, while the provided code does not directly implement a B-tree data structure, it exhibits behavior similar to a B-tree through its use of sorted order and efficient searching, which are fundamental characteristics shared by both B-trees and binary search trees (BSTs).
